FOR NEW PROJECTS:

1.Create a new Repo in Github

2.Copy the URL
	a. Go to project Repo
	b. Click on Green Button "<> Code"
	c. Local Tab -> HTTPS Tab
	d. copy URL (https://.../repoName)

3. Go to workspace where you want the repo (folder) to be copied to
	faq: When you create a repo in Github you are essentially creating a
	new folder. Because of this when you clone the repo to your
	selected workspace (ex. downloads folder) it will create a new
	folder (Whatever you named your repo) in your downloads folder

4. Use the following command to clone repo to workspace
	git clone REPLACE THIS WITH THE URL

5. In the Command prompt use the follwing commands
	ls
		this will list all items in current directory, you should see
		the directory that was just copied from github
	cd DIRECTORYNAME
		This will move you inside the directory

FOR EXISTING PROJECTS:
6. Do work, changes, whatever to directory
	Next couple steps will be to update the Github repo with any changes you
	have done.

7. Creating a new Branch (Not required but recommended)
	faq: Do you feel like the changes you made might break everything but
		you still want others to see or just want to save you work?
		Create a new Branch!
	a. use the command -> git checkout -b [Branch name]
		give branch name example [first inital + lastname] -> mgarciapaez

8. Add edited file/files to staging area
	a. use command -> git add FILENAME.EXT
	b. replacing FILENAME.EXT with a period '.' adds everything in current 
		directory to staging area (dangerous if not in correct directory)

9. Commit changes to repo
	a. use command -> git commit -m "Give a small description of your changes"
	
10. Push your work to github
	a. Use command -> git push
		if on seperate branch, you will push your branch to github and
		it will be under a different tab than the main(origin) branch
	b. use command -> git push origin [BRANCH NAME]
		This will merge your branch with the main branch

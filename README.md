## Description
TuneTribe is a social platform designed for music enthusiasts and artists alike. Users can share their
favorite songs, create music-related posts, comment on friends' posts, and recommend songs/artists to
each other. Artists have a dedicated space to upload their music, gain a following, and track royalties. The
platform fosters community interaction while providing exposure for emerging artists. Moderators ensure
a positive user experience by managing comments and addressing any issues. Admins oversee the
platform's operations and have the authority to ban users or artists if necessary.
